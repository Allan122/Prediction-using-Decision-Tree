This project focuses on implementing a decision tree algorithm for predictive modeling. Decision trees are a popular supervised learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. The goal of this project is to build a decision tree model that can predict outcomes based on input features.

### Objectives
- Implement a decision tree algorithm using Python.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Train the decision tree model on the training data and evaluate its performance.
- Visualize the decision tree to understand its decision-making process.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
